# Dynamic CV Website

I have completed the **Dynamic CV Website with Admin Panel** project using MVC5. This project is a personal CV application that allows users to create and manage a dynamic resume.

## Project Details

During the development process, I created a dynamic website using the **Entity Framework DbFirst** approach. I learned and implemented the **Generic Repository** pattern for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Additionally, I added authentication mechanisms and login functionality for the admin panel. This project helped me strengthen my existing knowledge and gain new skills.  

Through the use of the technologies and approaches in this project, I developed an application that meets all the requirements of a professional CV website. It was a valuable learning experience for both improving my software development knowledge and problem-solving skills.

Special thanks to my mentor, **Murat Yücedağ**, for his guidance.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Framework**

- **MS SQL Server**
- **Repository Design Pattern**
